Makefile Improved
=================

Overview
--------

This package provides improved syntax highlighting for Makefiles.

Targets are available as symbols, so you can use ``CTRL-R`` to jump 
to them.

.. note:: Following files are taken from original Makefile Package shipped
    with Sublime Text 2/3:

    - Make.sublime-build
    - Miscellaneous.tmPreferences
    - Makefile.sublime-settings

    These Packages are re-distributed, because Makefile package is 
    automatically disabled (put on ignored_packages list).
